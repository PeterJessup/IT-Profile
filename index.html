<h1>PETER JESSUP - IT PROFILE

</p>
<p>I have found throughout my current chosen career paths and experience hiring people that attempting to make yourself sound unique through an interesting fact often comes off as unoriginal and not compelling. Instead, I shall just say that I have an interest in sports and video games and unfortunately lead the life of a simpleton.
</p>
<p>I am including a picture of myself and a childhood idol.
